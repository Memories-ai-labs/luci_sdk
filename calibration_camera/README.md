# Stereo Camera Calibration and Depth Estimation — Complete Workflow

This README provides a **comprehensive pipeline** for calibrating **camera intrinsics** and **stereo extrinsics**,  
then validating results via **OpenCV-based depth reconstruction** and **AI-based CREStereo depth estimation**.

> Designed for reproducibility on Windows/macOS/Linux with OpenCV 4.x.  
> Supports both **Chessboard** and **Charuco** calibration targets.  
> Outputs are YAML-compatible and can be reused for 3D reconstruction, robot vision, or LUCI dual-eye experiments.

# Preparation

If anyone would like to try the depth estimation or stereo calibration task for LUCI, don't forget to connect 2 LUCI pins on the same internet route and fix them on a holder. Here, I design a holder and share the STL file for all users.

## 🧩 1) Environment Setup

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy pyyaml matplotlib
# Optional for depth visualization & AI models
pip install open3d torch torchvision timm
```

> ⚠️ Make sure your OpenCV build includes **contrib** modules (for Charuco / ximgproc).

---

## 📷 2) Calibration Target

- **Chessboard** (recommended): e.g. inner corners = 8×5 (9 × 6 total squares)  
- **Charuco Board**: e.g. `DICT_5X5_100`, specify both square & marker sizes  
- Measure **square size** precisely in **meters** (e.g. `--square 0.030`)

> Keep the target **flat**, **matte**, and **rigid** to minimize reflections and warping.

---

## 🎞️ 3) Data Capture (Stereo Images or Videos)

Capture **20–40 synchronized pairs** from diverse poses:  
- Vary distance, tilt, and rotation  
- Cover all corners of the field of view  
- Ensure both cameras capture the **same moments**

**Example folder:**
```
calibration_images_dual_eye/
├── cam1_0001.png
├── cam1_0002.png
│   ...
├── cam2_0001.png
├── cam2_0002.png
│   ...
```
> `cam1` = left, `cam2` = right.  
> If using video, extract frames before calibration.

---

## 🎯 4) Intrinsic Calibration

Run separately for each camera (left/right):

```bash
python calibration_images_dual_eye/calibration_intrinsics.py
```

**Output YAML (per camera):**
- `K` – 3×3 intrinsic matrix  
- `D` – distortion coefficients `[k1, k2, p1, p2, k3, …]`  
- `size` – (width, height)  
- `rms` – reprojection error  

> 🎯 **Good target RMS:** < 0.5 px (ideal), < 1.0 px (acceptable)

---

## 🔗 5) Stereo Extrinsic Calibration

After both intrinsics are available:

```bash
python calibration_images_dual_eye/stereo_calibration.py
```

**Outputs (`stereo_params.yaml`):**
- `K1`, `D1`, `K2`, `D2`
- `R`, `T` – rotation & translation (left→right)
- `R1`, `R2`, `P1`, `P2`, `Q` – rectification & projection matrices
- `rms_stereo` – stereo reprojection error
- `baseline` – distance between camera centers (in m) 

> If RMS > 1.0 px or baseline is unrealistic, remove poor frames and re-run calibration.

---

## 🌈 6) Depth Estimation & Point-to-Point Measurement  
*(OpenCV Stereo Batch Pipeline with 3D Measurement UI)*

After stereo calibration, run **stereo_depth_opencv.py** to batch-process all stereo pairs and interactively measure 3D distances.

## Run

    python depth_estimation_opencv/stereo_depth_opencv.py

## What it does

- Finds all stereo pairs in `../test_images` by filename keys `cam1` / `cam2`
- Loads calibration from `../stereo_out/stereo_params.yaml` (supports OpenCV YAML and JSON-in-YAML)
- Rectifies images, computes disparity via StereoSGBM, reprojects to 3D using `Q`
- Saves rectified views, disparity/depth visualizations, and raw arrays
- Optional per-pair interactive UI to click two points and log their 3D distance

## Processing steps

1. Pair detection (filename matching with `cam1` → `cam2`)
2. Rectification (`stereoRectify` + `initUndistortRectifyMap`)
3. Stereo matching (StereoSGBM, blockSize=5, numDisparities=192)
4. 3D reprojection (`reprojectImageTo3D`, units in meters)
5. Depth visualization (pseudo-color, 95th-percentile normalization)
6. Batch saving (PNG + NPY)
7. Interactive 2-point measurement (optionally save CSV + annotated image)

## Output directory structure



## 🧠 7) AI Depth Estimation — CREStereo Integration

For deeper evaluation, the same stereo pairs can be processed with **CREStereo**,  
a learning-based stereo matching model by Megvii Research.

```bash
python depth_estimation_CREStereo/image_depth_estimation.py
```

**Model Highlights:**

- Cross-scale cost-volume aggregation with attention mechanisms  
- Handles low-texture and reflective regions better than classical SGBM  
- Compatible with pretrained weights (`crestereo_init_iter5.pth`)  

**Outputs:**

- `out.jpg` – visualized depth map  

You can compare CREStereo depths with OpenCV SGBM outputs to evaluate precision, smoothness, and robustness.

> 💡 Recommendation: use CREStereo for final visual datasets or AI fusion training;  
> keep OpenCV SGBM for fast calibration validation and metric evaluation.

## ✅ 8) Validation Checklist

- Rectified images → epipolar lines are **horizontal**  
- Depth maps → smooth and consistent with object distance  
- Measured distances → within **±0.2–1 cm** of real-world value  
- CREStereo → superior performance in low-texture or glossy regions
